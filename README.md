# Better-Tellraws
 An easier way to write tellraws. By supercam19

I would add more features, but I'm not sure what else I can add.

# Installing
- Download the zip attached to the latest release.
- Extract the .zip file
- Open a command line and type:
`pip install re`
and
`pip install pyperclip`

# Using
- Set the "input.json" file to the tellraw you want to create
- Open a command line
- Navigate to the Better-Tellraws folder
- `python main.py`
- The new tellraw will copy to your clipboard and be written to "output.txt"

# Features
- Compiles multi-line tellraws into single line.
